<h1>Venue Page Project</h1>
<p>This react app project was created for a fictional music festival that the team named Barclays Bash. Our team used various react libraries and components such as the FullCalender component to implement a calendar that will display the events happening at the Barclays Center. We also made the user experience more interactive by including an aerial view of the stadium. We used CSS to make the user interface reminiscent of a night-time concert.</p>
